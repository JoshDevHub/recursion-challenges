# Recursion Challenges

A small project with challenges that should be solved recursively.

## The Challenges

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**
Create a method that takes in a number and returns an array with that many numbers from the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). Solved iteratively and recursively.

2. **Merge Sort**
Create a method that takes in an array and sorts it in order using the [merge sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort).
